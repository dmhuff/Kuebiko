About
-----
In Japanese mythology, [Kuebiko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuebiko) is the god of knowledge. Likewise, __this__ Kuebiko is a repository for notes, information, and ideas.

Kuebiko came about to fulfill my desire to run NV on multiple platforms. At the time, I was forced to use a Windows PC at work, and there wasn't an alternative to NV that did what I wanted. I wrote Kuebiko to fill this gap.

Once I was able to use a Mac at work, however, the need for an application like Kuebiko lessened greatly. Also, [several alternatives](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=cross+platform+notational+velocity+clone) to NV now exist, rendering further development of Kuebiko superfluous. While functional, the application should be considered an alpha; there are probably a few (potentially nasty) bugs lurking in the code. I've made the source code available in hopes that someone may find it useful.
